## Requires
- python 3.6+
- kivy 2.0.0
## How To Run the Code
kivy can be used on multiple platforms, to run the code on desktop just run it with python:
``` 
python main.py
```
but to run this code on android you need to use the `Kivy Launcher` app.
>you can use `Pyinstaller package` to package this app as standalone app on windows, but you need `Buildozer` to package this app on android.
