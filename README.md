This is my first slicing app project.

## Compile Issue
kivy can be used on multiple platforms, to run the code on desktop just compile it with python:
``` 
python main.py
```
but to compile on mobile you need to use the Kivy Launcher app.

>you can use Pyinstaller Package to package this app as standalone app on windows, but you need Buildozier to package this app on android.
