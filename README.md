## Requires
- python 3.6+
- kivy 2.0.0
## How To Run the Code
- (Kivy can be used on multiple platforms).

  To run the code on <b>windows/linux</b> just run it with python that already installed kivy in it:
  ``` 
  python main.py
  ```
  but to run this code on <b>android</b> you need to use the `Kivy Launcher` app.
- you can use `Pyinstaller package` to package this code as standalone app <b>on windows</b>, but you need `Buildozer` to package this code as standalone app <b>on android</b>.
